# React portfolio project

This project is bootstrapped from create-react-app

To install dependencies:

```node
npm install
```

Then to run the project on a development server:

```node
npm start
```

Finally, to build:

```node
npm run build
```

Since this is deployed on netlify and using React Router, a redirect is needed.

```node
./public/_redirects
```
