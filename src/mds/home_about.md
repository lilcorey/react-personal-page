## About Me 
* * *

Hey, I'm Corey. I currently work as a Software Developer in Seattle. I enjoy learning all things software engineering. With that said, this site is a project to brush up on developing web technologies and a place (blog) to keep track of programming topics I read about. 

You can find me on GitHub [@lilcorey][1] and LinkedIn [@corey-edelman][2]
